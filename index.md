I am a machine learning researcher focusing on reinforcement learning, multi-agent learning, and Bayesian inference. Currently, I am the techlead of multi-agent learning at Huawei Noah's Ark (AI Lab), responsible for delivering research work on multi-agent system and its application for autonomous driving. Before joining Huawei, I was a senior manager at the Science department of American International Group, where I led a machine learning research team to develop AI-powered methodology innovations for insurance problems. In 2018, I was awarded UK Exceptional Talent in Machine Learning/AI by the Home Office.<a href="https://www.yangyaodong.com/" target="_blank"> Click to Enter Personal Home Page.</a></p>
