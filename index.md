Yushan Zhou is currently studying in the third year of master's degree in AI Lab, School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University. She focuses on Botzone (www.botzone.org.cn), a universal online multi-agent game AI platform, designed to evaluate different implementations of game AI by applying them to agents and compete with each other, featuring an ELO ranking system and a contest system for users to evaluate their AI programs. She has held seven multi-agent game AI competitions on Botzone. This year, as a student chair, she is currently organizing IJCAI 2020 Mahjong AI Competition, held as part of IJCAI-PRICAI 2020.
